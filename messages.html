“Happy Birthday, Amayi…🫂🫂🫂🫂
Some people enter our lives quietly,
but leave echoes that stay forever.
You’re one of them.
You’re not just a person to me—you’re a feeling.
A calm in chaos, a softness in pain,
a warmth in all my cold days.

If I could gift you anything today,
I’d give you the comfort you’ve given me,
the peace you carry in your smile,
and the strength you hide behind your silence.

On your special day,
I just want you to know this…
You matter.
You’re valued.
You’re loved—more than you realise💞💞.

May this birthday bring you
the love you deserve,
the peace you’ve been searching for,
and moments that make your heart breathe again.

Happy Birthday, Amayi💗💗.
You’re truly special…
in ways I can never fully put into words.”
